## Overview of the Evaluation Reports

As a venture capital firm, we want to see startup businesses succeed and we want to be able to assist in that success. The challenging part about investing in startup businesses is that it can be risky. There is no guaranteed recipe for success, and often times than not, businesses fail. With the help of the Startup Evaluation Report application, we can run an algorithm that can predict whether an applicant will be successful with help and funding from our firm.
